I was thinking a bit about life in nature vs in cities. It seems like there are two sides to an argument: 
The first being that nature is very peaceful, and the second being that nature especially deep in jungles is filled with suffering due to plants and animals constantly trying to compete with each other. 
Knowing that I'd probably never get a response I sent this email to a guy who lives in the jungle who was on Lex Fridman:
<br> <br>

Evolution does not seem like a very peaceful or happy process, but rather one of great suffering. 
The plants and animals which come into existence are quite beautiful but the process that brought 
them here I see as brutal. Is it not the same process that happens everyday in the jungle? 
The following quotes appeal to me, but I don't want them to.
<br> <br>

<em>
“I don’t see [the jungle] so much erotic. I see it more full of obscenity. It’s just – Nature 
here is vile and base. I wouldn’t see anything erotical here. I would see fornication and 
asphyxiation and choking and fighting for survival and growing and just rotting away. Of 
course, there’s a lot of misery. But it is the same misery that is all around us. The trees 
here are in misery, and the birds are in misery. I don’t think they sing. They just screech in pain.”
<br>
- Werner Herzog

“The jungle seems peaceful, but in fact, there is murder and death in every direction and 
the plants and animals consistently try to kill each other”.

What do you make of these quotes? How do the animals really feel in the jungle? Isn't there a 
constant struggle to survive? Are animals in constant fear of being eaten or starving? As a 
result of governments, cities, supply chains, and law, humans mostly no longer have to deal 
with these issues. Some would argue that the pathway of happiness is through industrialization! 
How do you respond to this argument that the jungle is a disorderly place with mass murder and 
starvation? Are animals okay with dying? For example when you mentioned that if un-hunted, some 
populations of animals grow old and suffer, does this mean that they are okay with being hunted 
and eaten? How do animals feel dying!!???! You mentioned that you were sort of calm/at peace 
every time you've been on the brink of death. Perhaps this is how animals feel as well?
