After writing a cover letter and an email knowing damn well that there are subtle grammatical errors in it, I thought about how I could use AI to remove those imperfections,
but as a reader of a cover letter I’d prefer those imperfections to be present.
It so much more authentic. I think authenticity will be a big part of the future with AI.
The game isn't to be objectively the best, but to be fully authentic, and to thereafter compare yourself to those around you.
This isn't something that should be overlooked because the alternative is fusing with AI or
letting AI be the primary creator of art. Chess is played to compete with humans not AI and this is what all art will become.
It’s undeniable that AI will be able to create art that any human in any setting likes the best, and therefore be able to win
any art competition, so this is why in the world of AI, it’s almost a chance to be less connected to technology.

The only problem arises when the AI is indistinguishable or better than humans in all respects. The hard truth is that we may
be better off only communicating with AIs. But with wireheading, and such, do we really want what’s best for us?
