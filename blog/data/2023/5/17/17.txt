Did a bunch of little updates to the blog today. The scammers should be gone now. I blacklisted "www" and "http" the scammers always post a link in the comments. The name field is also mandatory now. The comments have nice looking dates and the blog archive has a line now. I think I'll probably put comments in the projects and thoughts section. I may replace the thoughts section with a second blog thats just for science stuff.
