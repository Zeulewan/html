dark matter is mysterious stuff in space. it doesn&#039;t interact with light, so it&#039;s hard to see. scientists think it&#039;s in galaxies, like ours. but we don&#039;t know exactly how it&#039;s spread out in each one. some theories say it forms a big halo around galaxies. but it&#039;s not the same in every galaxy. this isn&#039;t because of aliens. we&#039;re still studying and trying to understand dark matter. my theory: it&#039;s a big pile of shit from god
