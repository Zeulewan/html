The universe is expanding, and the rate that it is expanding is increasing. But what about the rate of the rate of expansion? What's that doing? 
Is it increasing or decreasing? It could be that all the rates of change are increasing but the like millionth derivative is decreasing. 
Maybe the universe will eventually start contracting, or maybe time will slow down and then eventually start running backwards. Both possibilities 
would result in another big bang.<br>
Now, the big bang couldn't have been perfectly uniform since things are not spread out equally in the universe.
Why the hell was it not perfectly uniform? Idk if that assumption is even accepted out there. Maybe it was.
Maybe it's that space is expanding in a non-uniform way.
But assuming the big bang wasn't a perfect singularity, that means that it could have been possible for something to interfere with it in some way or another.
If we could get around the uncertainty principle then we'd be able to theoretically predict what would happen throughout the course of 
the entire universe after a big bang, and it could be that it's possible to pass information through the "singularity." It could be that we could create 
any reality with any set of planets and galaxies however we want. Or we could even recreate ourselves! What if there are like multiple alien civilizations 
that all want to be recreated after the big bang, and we all have to collaborate on how we're gonna go into the big bang because if just one person messes it up
the entire course of time would be messed up because of the butterfly effect.
