My cousin and I used to be really interested in scary scary stories as kids.
We only knew one or two scary stories that people told us in the past, so every time I slept at his house we would repeat the same scary two stories. 
Over the course of years, it was like playing a game of broken telephone with ourselves. Recently Jericho told me 'The Hand' story for the last time.
After he told it to me I wondered why we never googled the real story. So we did, and as we expected, the <a href="https://www.scaryforkids.com/hand/"><font color="#1187FC">real version</font></a> was much different than the one we would tell each other.
