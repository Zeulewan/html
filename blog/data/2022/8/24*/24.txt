Hmm. Taking the average position of all the stars, 
we get a grid of stars all fixed in position relative to each other.
In no gravitation field, is a rotating observer inertial? 
Relative to all the stars an astronaut 
Is it possible that it is equally valid to say the universe is revolving around an astronaut in space as it is to say an astronaut is rotating in space?
Maybe centripetal acceleration is just a product of the universe revolving around you! <br>idk smthn like that
