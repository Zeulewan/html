Here are the books I finished this summer.

I'd say Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets was my favourite Harry Potter yet, but my favourite book over all was definitely Cosmos by Carl Sagan. Carl Sagan has such a beautiful outlook on the universe that I literally teared up a couple times reading this book (not that I didn't while reading Astrophysics for People in a Hurry either). All in all, this concept of the "cosmic perspective" is really one that I resonate with.
