I spent today learning about arduinos. I bought an arduino pro mini and an accelerometer for my

The graph above shows the acceleration due to gravity.
The lines show the different axes (one of the lines is too light to see).
As I rotate the accelerometer different lines get higher because relative to the accelerometer, 
the gravity is changing directions. What's neat is that the accelerometer is what I'd call "Einsteinian" by default.
The acceleration points upwards when at rest with respect to the surface of the earth, which you could say acknowledges relativity.
You can program it to remove the acceleration upwards to make it "Newtonian."
