This is a video for a poem I wrote about having to reach in a soapy sink of water for dishes while washing them. I wrote the poem with a friend name Loki in grade 10, and we filmed it in my basement with help from Lucy. I then edited the video in Final Cut, and made music for it in on my roland JDXI synth using logic, and imported it into Final Cut where I added more sounds. There are a couple custom effects used in this video such as the one used at time 1:10. I had a friend make it for me using motion 5.
