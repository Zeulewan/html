A video by Jasper Whyte and Zeul Mordasiewicz with the help of Kalim Sodhi-Popovic.

This is a vid we made for our pop music class in grade 11 right before covid.
Jasper and I recorded this in Logic at my house. We used random lyric generator and random loops in logic.
A couple days later we went to value village and bought some technology and destroyed it during the music video. 
The idea for the vid is that we are nerds who get fed up with our computers then become all punk and act cool. 
It was soo feezing cold when we shot this, and I can still see the chill in my face when watching the video.
We lip-synced along while kalim filmed it for us. I edited it in Final Cut. It took a lot of work to get
that TV to look like it turned on. I used a motion VFX plug in for the stabiliation, and got a little 
carried away with the kaleidoscope and glitch effects. I love that we're serious about the video, and weren't
really trying to make it funny at the time. Now I wish I made it look a little more silly.
