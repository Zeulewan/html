I have begun a new project! Following Ben Eater's 6502 project guide, I am building an 8 bit computer! Here is a photo of the current status:

The top section is the clock module. It's made from three 555 timers, one in each mode. and from left to right it has a hex inverting gate, a quad and gate, and a quad or gate.
The 6052 chip's data bus is begin hard codded in this picture with a couple resistors to the "no op" code.
The arduino on the bottom is being used as a logic analyzer to look at the data and address busses.

Redoing all the connections to give the data lines their own bus. Unfortunately the address lines will not get a bus because there's 16 of them.
<br> <br>
September 8th 2024: I've finally finished the data bus and the sorta address bus. That was a huge pain. 2.jpg There's still a lot more to do.

September 11th 2024: Pretty big milestone today. 1.gif

I've sadly moved on to other projects. I am not sure if I will come back to the 8 bit computer for a while :(
