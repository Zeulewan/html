At launch canada in august 2023, Nikolai and I build the flight computer below. It's just an arduino nano 33 BLE sense and an SD card.

As the graph shows, the rocket's apogee was 181 meters

My next step is to get GPS, and radio working. My next step after that is making a custom PCB. Then my next project after that will be something AI related or maybe continuing my API work. I thought the 3B1B python stuff would work but it seems like the project is deprecated. <br>

Got the GPS working. I had buy a teensy because the nanos don't support multiple 
hardware serial connections, and don't do software serial. Will have to choose
a IMU/barometer because I don't wanna do that Can bus crap.

Just got the radio working super exited about this!
So all I gotta do now is write the code, and connect the antenna to a raspberry pi, and I'm done!

The computer is fully working on a battery! I got a nice barrel jack and a switch, to make life easier.

With the help of my friend Nathan Liu, we turned this into a PCB! This is now the board that MARS my student team uses for their avionics:
