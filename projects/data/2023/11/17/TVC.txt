Mizi and I are working on TVC together. I'm working on controlling it and he's working on building it.
This is the computer we're gonna use,

September 8th 2024: 
The current status of this project is that I'm not gonna do TVC for a model rocket. I'm helping MACH do TVC for the liquid engine. 
I realized TVC for model rockets is pretty easy and there's not much to learn. I already know about PIDs and stuff. The real learning would be simulating the rocket in MATLAB using state space 
transfer functions from control systems. That would be an awesome project but I'll leave that one for later.
